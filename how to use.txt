Manual

This document provides an overview of how to use the workout tracking application across its core features: onboarding, profile setup, routines, scheduling, workout execution, history, and analytics. It is designed for users and testers evaluating the workflow of the app.

1. Getting Started
Launching the App

The app can be opened either through a mobile build (Expo Go or development build) or through the web version in the browser.
Both platforms share the same account and Firestore backend, meaning profile settings and logged workouts persist across devices.

Signing In

Users must authenticate to access their profile, routines, and history.
Once signed in, all navigation tabs become available.

2. Profile Setup

The app begins with user profile information. The user provides:

Fitness goal (Build Muscle, Lose Fat, Increase Endurance)

Experience level

Basic physical metrics if needed in future versions

This information influences:

Auto-generated training plans

Recommended workout structure

Scheduling logic

Changes to the profile update recommendations immediately.

3. Routines
Viewing Saved Routines

Users can open the Saved Routines tab to see all custom and auto-generated routines.

Creating Routines

Users can:

Build completely custom routines by selecting exercises

Add sets and reps

Save routines for later use

Editing Routines

Each routine supports:

Renaming

Adding exercises

Removing exercises

Reordering (optional future extension)

Routine edits update immediately in Firestore.

4. Auto-Generated Training Plans

The Schedule screen provides an automatic weekly plan builder based on:

User goal

Available templates stored in the app

When the user selects Generate Plan:

The app creates seven routines (one per day)

Assigns them to the weekly schedule

Saves all generated routines with the generated flag

If a plan already exists, the user can:

Replace the plan

Keep both (which duplicates the routines)

The user may still manually edit or assign routines afterward.

5. Weekly Schedule

The Week View consists of seven day slots (Day 1–Day 7).
Each day displays:

Assigned routine name

Tap to open routine selection if none assigned

Hold or tap options to start workout or change assigned routine

The schedule always highlights the current day.

Users can freely reassign routines at any time without affecting saved progress.

6. Starting a Workout

The workout flow differs depending on what is being performed:

Routine Workouts

Opening a routine initiates a session view showing all exercises and their sets.
Users can:

Log weight and reps

Complete exercises sequentially

Finish and save the entire session
Tracked data is pushed into history.

Manual Logging

Users may track individual exercises outside of routines.
Each entry logs:

Exercise

Weight

Reps

Date and timestamp

Cardio Sessions

Cardio sessions collect:

Speed

Duration

Distance (calculated or manually entered)

Calories (if applicable)

All session types store a timestamp, making them appear chronologically in History.

7. Workout History

The History screen aggregates all logged entries:

Routine sessions

Individual strength sets

Cardio sessions

Entries are sorted newest first.

Managing History

Available actions:

Long-press an item to trigger delete confirmation

Tap the trash icon to delete directly

Undo delete (5-second window)

Clear all workout history with a confirmation step

Each entry stores a Firestore reference, allowing precise deletion.

8. Analytics

The Analytics section summarizes performance over time.
Depending on data availability, analytics may include:

Volume trends

Frequency of training

Estimated progression

Cardio totals

The analytics feature reads directly from History, so all logged sessions automatically contribute.

9. Sync and Persistence

All user data (profile, routines, schedule, history) is stored in Firebase under:

users/{uid}/...


This means:

Mobile and web share the same data

The app restores all state after sign-in

Generated routines and schedules remain persistent unless changed or deleted by the user

Offline behavior is limited but may allow read caching depending on Firebase settings.

10. Error Handling and Feedback

Throughout the app:

Invalid profile data disables dependent features

Schedule selection prevents assigning nonexistent routines

History deletion includes confirmation and undo mechanisms

Async actions (loading, saving, fetching) show visual feedback when needed

Users are guided to correct issues without breaking the workflow.
