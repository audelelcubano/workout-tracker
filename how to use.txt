This app is built with Expo SDK 54 and runs inside the Expo Go app on iOS or Android. No Xcode or Android Studio required.

1. Install Expo Go on your phone

iPhone: open the App Store and search for Expo Go (publisher: Expo Project).

Android: open the Google Play Store and search for Expo Go.

2. Install Node.js (only if you want to run it on your computer)

Go to the website: nodejs.org

Download and install the LTS version (20.x or newer).

After install, open your terminal or PowerShell and check:
node -v
npm -v

3. Unzip the project

Extract the zip file anywhere on your computer (for example, Desktop).

Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows).

Navigate into the project folder. Example:
cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\workout-tracker

4. Install dependencies

Run this once inside the project folder:
npm install

5. Start the development server

Run:
npx expo start

This will open a new browser tab with Expo Dev Tools.

In your terminal, you will also see a QR code.

6. Open the app on your phone

On iPhone: open the Camera app, point it at the QR code, and tap the link that appears. It will open inside Expo Go.

On Android: open the Expo Go app and use the built-in QR scanner.

You should now see the app running.

7. Test the features

Switch between Home and Workouts tabs.

In Workouts:

Tap “Select an exercise…” → a modal list will slide up from the bottom.

Pick an exercise (Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Barbell Row).

Enter weight, reps, and sets.

Tap “Save Workout”.

The saved workout is logged in the terminal where the server is running. Example:
Workout saved: { exercise: 'Bench Press', weight: '135', reps: '10', sets: '3' }

8. Editing the exercise list

All exercises are stored in a single file:
app/data/exercises.ts

To add or remove an exercise:

Open the file in a text editor.

Modify the list. Example:

export const EXERCISES = [
"Bench Press",
"Squat",
"Deadlift",
"Overhead Press",
"Barbell Row",
"Pull-Ups"
];

Save the file. The app will reload automatically and the new exercise will appear in the list.

9. Stopping the server

In the terminal, press Ctrl + C to stop the Expo server.
